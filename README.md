## 📦 Supply Chain Disruption Forecasting

This project predicts **supply chain disruptions** using historical backorder data and machine learning. It uses data preprocessing, feature engineering, model tuning with Optuna, and is deployed through a **Streamlit app** for easy predictions.

---

### 🚀 Features

* ⏳ Handles missing values with KNN imputation
* 📊 Removes multicollinearity with VIF & correlation heatmaps
* 🧠 Trains and tunes multiple models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
* 🧪 Uses Optuna for hyperparameter optimization
* 📈 Visualizes model performance (ROC, PR curves)
* 🌍 Streamlit app for real-time prediction

### 📊 Model Performance

The tuned **Random Forest** model is used for deployment. It was selected based on cross-validation F1-score. Evaluation metrics include:

* Precision, Recall, F1-Score
* Confusion Matrix
* ROC Curve
* Precision-Recall Curve
